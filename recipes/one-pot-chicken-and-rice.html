            <li>3 cups chicken stock</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Herb Yogurt</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup plain Greek yogurt</li>
            <li>1/4 cup cilantro</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons minced fresh dill</li>
            <li>1 garlic clove, grated</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice (from 1 to 2 lemons)</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Make the chicken. Pat chicken dry with paper towels and season all over with 1 teaspoon of the salt.</li>
            <li>In a small bowl, combine 1 teaspoon of the smoked paprika, 1 teaspoon of the chili powder, the brown sugar, and the black pepper.</li>
            <li>Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Once the oil is glistening, working in batches as necessary, add the chicken in a single layer. Cook, undisturbed, until the chicken is lightly browned, 4-5 minutes per side. Season the chicken in the pot with the spice mixture and cook until golden all over, about 1 more minute. Transfer the chicken to a plate.</li>
            <li>Add another tablespoon of olive oil to the saucepan and reduce the heat to medium. Add the lemon slices in an even layer and cook until caramelized, 5-7 minutes. Transfer the lemons to the plate with the chicken. Add 2-3 tablespoons of the chicken stock to the pan and scrape up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan.</li>
            <li>Add the remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil to the saucepan. Once the oil is glistening, add the shallots and peppers and cook until softened, about 4 minutes. Add the rice, garlic, turmeric, dill, the remaining teaspoon of salt, the remaining teaspoon smoked paprika, and the remaining teaspoon chili powder. Cook, stirring, until spices are fragrant, about another 2 minutes. Add the chicken stock and stir to combine. Return the chicken, lemons and any collected juices to the saucepan. Bring to a simmer, cover and cook until the liquid has absorbed, the rice is tender, and the chicken is cooked through, about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, make the herb yogurt. In a medium bowl, stir together the yogurt, cilantro, dill, garlic, lemon juice, and salt.</li>
            <li>Divide the chicken and rice between plates and garnish with cilantro and dill. Serve the cilantro yogurt on the side.</li>
        </ol>
